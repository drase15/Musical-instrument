# Musical-instrument

My musical instrument uses 2 cap sensors, made from conductive paint on two pieces of wood. One controls the frequency of a sine curve in Processing, the other controls the amp of the sound produced from the sine curve. In the future I hope to be able to have the sensors control the gain of two different sound bites in processing, but for now I am happy with the result of the musical instrument. The use of the 10M ohm resistors make it so one does not have to directly touch the paint in order to change the values sent from Arduino.
